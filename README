Build instructions:

To build the JAR for Java Web Start, do:

mvn assembly:assembly    [ build the fat jar ]
ant -f sign.xml          [ sign the jar; you may need to customize sign.xml ]

The signed fat jar will be in target/DicomBrowser-m.n-jar-with-dependencies.jar

This requires a lot of things to be in your Maven 2 repository, notably
including:

* dcm4che2-core and dcm4che2-net (http://www.dcm4che.org)

* dcm4xnat and ExtAttr (built by "mvn install" in their directories)

* ui.jar from Apple's MRJ, version 1.5 or later; this is needed for compiling
  but is not included in the fat jar.  The easiest way to get this is to take it
  from a Mac with MRJ 1.5.0+; if that's not available, try looking around at
  http://developer.apple.com/java
  
* ij.jar from ImageJ, version as specified in the pom.xml and .classpath
  (but no earlier than 1.38L)
